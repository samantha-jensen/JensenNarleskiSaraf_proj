# Setup

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

exposure <- read.csv("ExposureConcentrationsRaw.csv")
# Would be a good idea to rename a lot of columns to make things easier

```

# Data Wrangling & Tidying

```{r}

# Calculate means and adding that as a summary dt would be good

```
# Initial Figures 

```{r}

exposure_fig1 <- exposure %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pollutant.Name, y = Total.Exposure.Conc)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(.~FIPS)

exposure_fig1
```
